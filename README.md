## 🚀 What It Does

- 🧠 **Encrypted Memory System** – Store, search, and manage private thoughts securely  
- 💬 **Local AI Chat** – Interact with your memory like a prototype AI  
- 🔎 **Smart Recall** – See past memory related to what you’re typing  
- 🕓 **Version Control** – Save and load snapshot backups anytime  
- 📤 **Export/Import** – Share memory between devices or backup your thoughts  
- 📡 **Simulated Broadcast Mode** – Future-ready for mesh + Bluetooth pinging
